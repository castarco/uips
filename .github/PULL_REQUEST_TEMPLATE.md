*Thanks for contributing! Here are some hints how to create a great pull request:*

* Follow the guidelines from
  https://github.com/dtr-org/uips/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
* Make sure you have read
  [UIP-1](https://github.com/dtr-org/uips/blob/master/UIP-0001.md) which
  describes how the UIP process works.
* If you create a new UIP, choose a number which is the next in sequence of all
  UIPs currently being in the repository or any open pull request.
* Sign your work (see
  https://github.com/dtr-org/unit-e/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sign-your-work)
* Add a summary of your changes and any additional context which is not in the
  commit messages to the description of the pull request (you are editing this
  right now ;-)
