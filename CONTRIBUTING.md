# Contributing to UIPs

The general process for Unit-e Improvement Proposals (UIP) is defined in
[UIP-1](UIP-0001.md). This describes how a UIP looks like and how it goes
through the stages of its life cycle. Please read that document as a starting
point when you intend to create a new UIP or become involved in any other way.

For creating new UIPs there is a [template](UIP-0000.md). You can start from
that by [forking the `dtr-org/uips`
repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/), copying the template,
filling it out, and submitting your proposal as a pull request.

Feedback and discussion on existing proposals is also welcome. Use the comments
in [pull requests](https://github.com/dtr-org/uips/pulls) to provide your input.

Let's improve Unit-e together.
