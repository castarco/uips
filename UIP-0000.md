## Abstract

A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.


## Motivation

The motivation is critical for UIPs that want to change the Unit-e protocol. It
should clearly explain why the existing protocol is inadequate to address the
problem that the UIP solves.


## Specification

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new
feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing,
interoperable implementations for any of the current Unit-e platforms.


## Rationale

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the
design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe
alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale should
provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important
objections or concerns raised during discussion.


## Backwards compatibility

All UIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section
describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The UIP must explain how
the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.


## Reference implementation

The reference implementation must be completed before any UIP is given status
"Final", but it need not be completed before the UIP is accepted. It is better
to finish the specification and rationale first and reach consensus on it before
writing code. The final implementation must include test code and documentation
appropriate for the Unit-e protocol.
